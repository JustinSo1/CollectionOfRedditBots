# CollectionOfRedditBots
This is a collection of all my Reddit bots I made. For any of them to work they require entering in the proper credentials in the praw.ini file. The proper credentials can be gotten by making a reddit account.<br /> 
## Newsletter
Registered reddit users are notified of any new posts in a specific subreddit. To add the registered users, add the reddit usernames you want to message in usernames.txt with each username separated by a new line.  
## Subscription
Bot will search for a keyword in a specific subreddit's top 30 hot posts while ignoring duplicates already in the database. If the keyword is found in a post then registered users will be notified through reddit's messaging system and given the link to the post.
